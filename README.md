## SPRINT 1 TASK 6 - Generics LVL 1

## Summary

This exercise covers two related concepts in Java: creating a non-generic class and working with generic methods.  The exercises focus on object storage and demonstrating the flexibility of generic types.

## Exercise 1

### Functionalities

- Create a class named `NoGenericMethods` that stores three arguments of the same type.
- Implement methods to store and retrieve these objects.
- Implement a constructor to initialize the three objects.  Ensure the constructor allows arguments to be passed in any order.

## Exercise 2: GenericMethods Class

### Functionalities

- Create a class named `Persona` with attributes `name` (String), `surname` (String), and `age` (int).
- Create a class named `GenericMethods` with a generic method that accepts three arguments of any type.
- This generic method should simply print the received arguments to the console.
